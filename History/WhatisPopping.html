            <h2>Definition:</h2>
            <p>Popping is a style of Street Dance which is centered around the technique of <i>"popping"</i> which means to quickly contract and relax muscles to create a jerking effect (a pop or hit) in the body</p><br>
            <h2>History:</h2>
            <p>The history of dance is confusing as there are many claims as to where they started, especially popping as there are many accounts and interpretations from according to their regions and circles of influence.<br>
               But the popping dance style was invented by a dancer named Boogaloo Sam as he was watching dancers who were locking on television. He then created popping which is a combination of rigid-robotic movement and loose flowing moves in Fresno, California</p>
